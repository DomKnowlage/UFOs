# UFOs

# Overview

Our team was comissioned to develope a website for the UFO community, we were given a list large list of sightings throughout the country. These sightings were catagorized by; state, time, date, shape of the object etc. With these parameters in place we were able to filter through the data and provide our fellow UFO believers a window to sightings around thier areas. This was honestly a very insightful project and has possibly made my team some believers as well.

# Results

To filetr through the results we have several parameters, we're gonna go with the "Date" filter. to filter through the date you type the date as such 1/10/2010 then hit the filter button. We'er going to mess this one up on purpose to showcase that the filters work.

# Summary 

In conclusion some drawbacks might be that the data isnt fully flesed out, maybe we could add some latitude and longitude features so we might be able to see a trend of sighting throughout the states. Another one I can think of is that there is not a lot of user interaction, one thing I can think of to change that is to create a forum for our fellow believers to coordinate togther and have meetups. Of course I would like to add a premium subscription package so that our users can get insights to all the latest UFO encounters and maybe even scale it up to make it a global UFO registry, the possibilities are limitless.
